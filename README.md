# Emotion classification using deep learning and EEG signals

Cross-wavelet spectrum images are used as dataset for emotion classification using 
SEED-1 dataset of EEG signals.

## Method - 1
Cross-wavelet spectrum of the original signal and it’s denoised version. A total of 12741 images were generated out of 13950 images.
 After 80-20 split, the dataset consisted of -
•	Training set – 10192 images
•	Test set – 2549 images
### Classes - 3 : (Positive, Negative and Neutral)


## Method - 2
Cross-wavelet spectrum of the positive signal and negative signals with neutral EEG signal. A total of 6200 images were generated out of 13950 images. After 80-20 split, the dataset consisted of -
•	Training set – 4960 images
•	Test set – 1240 images
### Classes - 2 : (Positive with neutral and Negative with neutral)

 The EEG signal of subject-1, Video-2 (Neutral signal- label-0), channel-1 was taken as the reference for generating positive with neutral and negative with neutral cross-wavelet spectrum images.
